# Simple Todo API

Hi everyone 👋🏾, this is a very simple Todo API written in Python 🐍 for the purposes of demonstrate hosting web applications and APIs in Azure.

I have a separate branch for each hosting service, where the hosting instructions are detailed 🧾 there-in. The idea is to explore the various way of hosting web apps and APIs in Azure. If your application needs great scalability and resilience 🌍🌎, you may need to do more work to achieve same.
